## Purpose:

I challenged myself to come up with a tool for sports bettors to try to get the edge on the kind of statistical analysis that the pros use. While I don't bet much myself, the prospect of coming up with a tool to help others make intelligent wagers, combined with my love of football, was too much to keep in my head.

I no longer actively maintain or have plans to improve this project, but I do plan to continue keeping it up to date.

## Features:

- View current week NFL matchups and compare team stats against each other.
- Quickly access betting information (spread, over/unders, moneylines) from a multitude of popular bookkeepers updated every hour.
- 80+ different team statistics to compare for each matchup, updated weekly.
- Easy-to-read tile mode: click for more details on each matchup.
- Grid-mode for more users who need more information on a spreadsheet-like interface.
